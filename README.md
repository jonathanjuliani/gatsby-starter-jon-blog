## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install**

    I used `yarn` but you may use `npm`

    Yarn:

    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

    Npm:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

    Npm with any dependencie issues (not expected):

    ```shell
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    yarn

    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```

    npm:

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

Change and use it as you wish.
